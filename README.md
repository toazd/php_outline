 Use the Bible to easily find definitions of words used in the Bible.

 Ever wonder what God meant when He used a certain word? How can we know with certainty
 that a definition is the truth? Easy: we use God's word to define God's words. But,
 manually doing that takes significant amounts of time. Using Noah Websters 1828 dictionary
 is an option but it comes with two caveats: it is not complete, and some of the definitions
 are sourced from the world. With this tool the process is nearly fully automated so you
 can get definitions more quickly without going off on time-consuming tangents that may
 cause you to lose focus on whatever you were studying.
 
 This tool significantly simplifies the process of learning how God defines His own words and
 it does so by comparing scripture to scripture. The King James version (1769) is the only
 resource used (John 6:63, 17:17, 1 Corinthians 2:13).
 
 If you don't believe that the King James Bible is a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve His
 word and every word of it is pure than this tool is not for you (John 8:42-47).
 
 The closest dictionary to the truth is Noah Websters 1828 dictionary but not only
 are some words and definitions from the Bible missing but also some definitions in
 NW1828 are from extra-Biblical sources.

 This tool is a suppliment and not a replacement for standard methods of obtaining definitions
 such as from the context itself.
